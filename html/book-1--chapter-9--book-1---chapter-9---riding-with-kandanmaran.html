<h1>Book 1 | Chapter 9 | Riding with Kandanmaran</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p>Vandhiyathevan could not sleep. He rolled around thinking about the discussion in the courtyard. He felt like a wasp stuck in a honey pot. He now knew more than he should. Tornadoes of thoughts ripped his confused mind apart. Slightly before dawn, tiredness took over him, and he fell asleep.</p>
<p>He did not awaken until well after dawn, when Kandanmaran came to wake him up.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“I slept like a log Kandanmara. It must have been the tiredness.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I came and checked on you after taking care of the guests, and you were deep in slumber.”</p>
<p>Vandhiyathevan knew that his friend was not telling the truth, but what could he do?</p>
<p>“Kandanmara, I must get ready and leave soon. It is getting late.”</p>
<p>“Why are you in so much of a hurry? I thought you would stay for a while.”</p>
<p>Vandhiyathevan quickly responded, “I had gotten news that my uncle in Thanjavur is terribly sick and is on his death bed. If I get delayed any further, I will not be able to see him alive.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Ok. I will then accompany you to the Kollidam river bank.”</p>
<p>Vandhiyathevan tried protesting; citing that Kandanmaran had several high profile guests to attend do, but Kandanmaran would have none of it.</p>
<p>The two friends rode their horses alongside, chatting happily about old times. They had almost reached the river shore, when Vandhiyathevan broached the topic about Kandanmaran’s sister.</p>
<p>“It is a pity that your sister is so shy. I was searching for her when we went to the <em>andhapuram</em>. She hid behind your mother most of the time. What is her name?”</p>
<p>“Manimegalai.”</p>
<p>“Ah. What a beautiful name.”</p>
<p>Kandanmaran shifted uneasily in his horse. “Vandhiyatheva, my friend, I would like to ask a favour from you. I would like you to please forget my sister. My parents have arranged another alliance for her.”</p>
<p>Vandhiyathevan was shocked, but tried his best not to show it out. “What happened, my friend? Even yesterday you were alluding to giving her in marriage to me?”</p>
<p>Kandanmaran blurted out — “Something has come up. Just last night.”</p>
<p>Vandhiyathevan smiled and said — “I am not surprised though. One of the rich influential guests must be the lucky one. Who would marry off their girl to a wandering poor soldier like me?”</p>
<p>Kandanmaran protested.</p>
<p>Vandhiyathevan could easily guess who the bridegroom would be. It would have to be none other than the Prince who rode in the covered Palanquin — Madhuranthaka Thevar. A marriage alliance to forge the leadership alliance.</p>
<p>“I have taken no offense Kandanmara. And I will not talk about it anymore. I can see it hurts you”, said Vandhiyathevan.</p>
<p>“There is more to this marriage. I cannot tell you more than that, Vandhiyatheva. We will fight together on the same side again. Please do not ask me any more details. I guarantee you though, that our friendship will remain the same ever.”</p>
<p>They had reached the Kollidam river bank, and there was a boat with two oarsmen and a single passenger, that was about to leave. The oarsmen decided to wait for Vandhiyathevan.</p>
<p>“One of my men will take your horse back to Kadambur, and another will accompany you on the boat. Farewell my friend, until we meet again.”</p>
<p>The lone passenger in the boat looked like a staunch Shaivite. He had sacred ash smeared all over him. The oarsmen were about to push the boat away from land, when there came a scream from afar — “Stop. Stop the boat. I would like to cross the river too.”</p>
<p>The voice sounded familiar and as the rotund figure neared, Vandhiyathevan recognized the familiar Alwarkadiyaan Nambi, who clumsily clambered onto the boat.</p>
