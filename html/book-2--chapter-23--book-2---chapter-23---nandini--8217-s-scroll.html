<h1>Book 2 | Chapter 23 | Nandini’s scroll</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p>Nandini was sitting at a bejewelled table, writing a scroll. It was a cool night, one of her handmaidens was fanning her, and yet, one could spot droplets of sweat glistening on her forehead. The message read –</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>Dear Prince Karikalan, it is with great hesitation that I am writing to you. I am hearing a lot of inauspicious rumours. I am not sure if they are reaching you, or perhaps you are not reacting to any of them. Your father is very sick. Despite several invitations from him to you, you still have not come to meet him. I would like to talk to you. If you think you cannot come to Thanjavur, we can meet at the palace of Sambuvarayar. The bearer of this scroll, Kandanmaran, who is the son of Sambuvarayar, can be trusted with any news from your side. Please revert with your response. – Nandini”</em></p>
<p>She looked at her handmaiden and said, “Go and bring our guest Kandanmaran here.” Kandanmaran walked into the room. He stood beside a window staring into the garden.</p>
<p>“Ayya, please sit down. I understand that the eyes that have just appreciated Kundavai’s beauty are hesitant to even see me.”</p>
<p>“A thousand Kundavai-s would not be equal to one Nandini Devi.” She laughed off his appreciation.</p>
<p>“Devi, you can talk about anything in front of me, but please do not speak highly of the Princess. When I think of the way she was supporting Vandhiyathevan, my blood boils even now.”</p>
<p>“Still, your imagination did get the better of you when you described your wrestling bout with Vandhiyathevan.”</p>
<p>Kandanmaran felt a little ashamed.</p>
<p>“I had to say something to that effect. It is true that he stabbed me in the back. I hope you do not doubt me?”</p>
<p>“No. I do not. But I do believe you should try and recall, once more, what happened the other night. You met the Periya Pazhuvettarayar and me midway through the passage. Do you remember that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do remember that, Devi.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember what you said when we met?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I do not remember the exact words. I do remember that I stood enchanted looking at you that day.”</p>
<p>“You said, ‘Sir, your Devi is the most beautiful woman on Earth.’.”</p>
<p>“Did I say that? No wonder his face flushed red. And I think that is probably the reason why he does not like me too much even now.”</p>
<p>“That is fine. As long as you like him, it is ok.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I do not like him either.”</p>
<p>“That is also fine. What matters is that I like him a lot. I am blessed to have such a wonderful husband.”</p>
<p>Kandanmaran sat confused not knowing how to respond.</p>
<p>“Ok. Let us get back to that night. After meeting us, what happened?”</p>
<p>“The soldier with the torch went ahead of me. I followed him, thinking of you. We reached the secret door. He opened it, and stepped aside. I entered the secret passage. And then someone stabbed me in the back. That is all I remember. I still feel he must have been waiting for me outside, and then stabbed me when he got the opportunity.”</p>
<p>“That is where I think you are mistaken. I do not think he was waiting outside. I think he was waiting inside the passageway, searching for a way out. Once he saw you, he followed you all the way out. On his way out he must have stabbed you in the back. But, once he did that, perhaps his conscience got the better of him. He took you to the flower seller’s house, left you there, and escaped.”</p>
<p>“In hindsight, I think your theory is more probable, Devi. In this world, you would either see beautiful women or intelligent women. It is rare to see someone both beautiful and intelligent. You are one of those rare ones that Brahma created.”</p>
<p>“I need you to do me a favour. Would you help me with a task?”</p>
<p>“Anything that you tell me to do, Devi?”</p>
<p>“I would like you to take a scroll to Prince Karikalan in Kanchi. After he has read the scroll, and if he is willing, please take him to Kadambur as a guest.”</p>
<p>“Devi – would that be a wise thing to do? You do know about the plan that is being devised by Periya Pazhuvettarayar and some of that area’s chieftains.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do know about those plans. But right now, all of us are threatened by one common enemy.”</p>
<p>“And who is that enemy?”</p>
<p>“The poisonous snake that came and visited you this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“The Princess …”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The Princess has sent your friend Vandhiyathevan to Lanka on the pretext of getting herbs to cure her father. That is a farce. The reality is that, after her father, she wants neither Aditya Karikalan nor Madhuranthakan to become the king.</p>
<p>She wants her favourite younger brother Arulmozhi to become the king. That is why she has sent for him. If Arulmozhi comes back, she can control the Chozha kingdom the way she wants. She will rule the kingdom by proxy. You know who will rule the kingdom with her – your dear friend Vandhiyathevan.”</p>
<p>“Aha. We need to stop this. Should we not tell my father and Pazhuvettarayar about this?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. There is no use telling them. They will not believe this. They do not believe that she is capable of all this. Kundavai’s dirty tricks should be countered by similar tricks. Would you do me the favour or not?”</p>
<p>She gave him the scroll. Caught in the smoke of lust, Kandanmaran held her hand, instead of taking the scroll, “I would do anything for you, Devi.”</p>
<p>Just at that time, there was commotion from the direction of the <em>latha mandapam</em> entrance. The Pazhuvettarayar entered the premises, and he seemed very angry. A parrot kept in a cage near the entrance fluttered its wings in surprise. The hand-maiden at the door let out a gasp on seeing the angry approach of the master of the palace.</p>
